CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTING Marcela linda: pipe + error status
CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTING Melo gay: redirects (only APPEND_IN left)
CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTING both: error status

PROBLEMS

1 - error status
2 - pipe
3 - if the file in "<" doesnt exist it doesnt work as it should (ex: cat < file.txt)
4 - there are functions with more than 4 parameters in *export_utils* and *echo2*
5 - functions with more than 25 lines

999 - Marcela's entire life (nothing i can do)

NOTES:

 - open_pipe should be called before executing the commands
 - create a function for error cases?
 - create struct to hold both message and exit status
