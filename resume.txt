PROBLEMS

1 - currently implementing export and unset
2 - add newline 'cat'
3 - change env in parser (checks if is a folder or executable file)
4 - cannot access should be just the first file but it does to every token* and it's doing for cat too
5 - error status
6 - ctrl d seg fault
7 - unset just by name and not by whole string (fds=a)
8 - Marcela's entire life (nothing i can do)

NOTES:
1 - in adding_new_token (parser) unnacessary tokens are created if "ls a >b" or "ls a> b"
2 - export only happens if it has '='
3 - the export value has to be immediatly after '=' and can be quoted ('fds= a' exports only ' ')


*ls: cannot access 'a': No such file or directory
 ls: cannot access '>': No such file or directory
 ls: cannot access 'b': No such file or directory
