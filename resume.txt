MAJOR PROBLEMS
1 - pipe doesn't always work

PROBLEMS

1 - there are functions with more than 4 parameters in *export_utils* and *echo2*
2 - functions with more than 25 lines
3 - when the output is not accepted by the input the pipe fails (ex: cat | ls) (cat is the worst)
4 - free structs
5 - error_message not updating g_exit_status
