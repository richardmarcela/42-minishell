CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTING Marcela linda: 1
CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTING Melo gay: redirects (heredoc not done and '<' not working properly?)

PROBLEMS

1 - there are functions with more than 4 parameters in *export_utils* and *echo2*
2 - functions with more than 25 lines
3 - when the output is not accepted by the input the pipe fails (ex: cat | ls) (cat is the worst)
4 - in bash all commands result in g_exit_status = 0 (?)
5 - when first command is empty, doesnt work properly (ex: "| ls" or "   | ls")
6 - when there are multiple pipes together, doesnt work properly (ex: " ls || echo a")
7 - free structs

CURRENTLY FIXING LEAKS

999 - Marcela's entire life (nothing i can do)
