PROBLEMS

1 - currently implementing export
3 - Marcela's entire life (nothing i can do)

NOTES:
1 - in adding_new_token (parser) unnacessary tokens are created if "ls a >b" or "ls a> b"
2 - export only happens if it has '='
3 - the export value has to be immediatly after '=' and can be quoted ('fds= a' exports only ' ')
