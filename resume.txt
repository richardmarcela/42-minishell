PROBLEMS

1 - export results in infinite cicle when "'$HOME'"
2 - add newline 'cat'
3 - change env in parser (checks if is a folder or executable file)
4 - cannot access should be just the first file but it does to every token and it's doing for cat too*
5 - error status
6 - ctrl d seg fault
7 - export (a=$HOME)
8 - in adding_new_token (parser) unnacessary tokens are created if "ls a >b" or "ls a> b"
9 - the whole program is working with 'getenv' which does not use our t_env



999 - Marcela's entire life (nothing i can do)

NOTES:
1 - export only happens if it has '='
2 - the export value has to be immediatly after '=' and can be quoted ('fds= a' exports only ' ')


*ls: cannot access 'a': No such file or directory
 ls: cannot access '>': No such file or directory
 ls: cannot access 'b': No such file or directory
