PROBLEMS

1 - add newline 'cat'
2 - cannot access should be just the first file but it does to every token*
3 - error status
4 - in adding_new_token (parser) unnacessary tokens are created if "ls a >b" or "ls a> b"
5 - the whole program is working with 'getenv' which does not use our t_env
6 - pipe

999 - Marcela's entire life (nothing i can do)

*ls: cannot access 'a': No such file or directory
 ls: cannot access '>': No such file or directory
 ls: cannot access 'b': No such file or directory
