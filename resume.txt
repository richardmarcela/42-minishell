CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTING Marcela linda: pipe + error status
CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTING Melo gay: redirects (only APPEND_IN left)

MAJOR PROBLEMS (!!!)

1 - absolute path bins don't work (ex: /bin/ls)
2 - trying to unset a env variable not ours ends in core dump (ex: PATH, USER, HOME)*

PROBLEMS

1 - error status
2 - in adding_new_token (parser) unnacessary tokens are created if "ls a >b" or "ls a> b"
3 - pipe
4 - if the file in "<" doesnt exist it doesnt work as it should (ex: cat < file.txt)

999 - Marcela's entire life (nothing i can do)

NOTES:

 - open_pipe should be called before executing the commands
 - create a function for error cases?
 - cat is a bit weird because of the forced '\n' (!!!)



*unset ends in core dump but changing its value works fine
