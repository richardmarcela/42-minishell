PROBLEMS

1 - currently implementing export
2 - handle signal needs to display a new prompt and not "^C"
3 - add newline cat
4 - change env in parser (dir or exec file)
5 - cannot access should be just the first file but it does to every token*
6 - Marcela's entire life (nothing i can do)

NOTES:
1 - in adding_new_token (parser) unnacessary tokens are created if "ls a >b" or "ls a> b"
2 - export only happens if it has '='
3 - the export value has to be immediatly after '=' and can be quoted ('fds= a' exports only ' ')


*ls: cannot access 'a': No such file or directory
 ls: cannot access '>': No such file or directory
 ls: cannot access 'b': No such file or directory
